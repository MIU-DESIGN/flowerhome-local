Remember, once you download flowerhome it's up to you how to use it,
so go nuts. Set things up and develop in a way that's easiest for
you. If using Sass is still a bit confusing for you, then remove it
and customize this template as you see fit.

If you're a bit uneasy about using Sass or just want a familiar setup,
take a few minutes and think about how much better a developer you
can become by just TRYING out new technologies. It may be tough at
first but it WILL make you a better developer. TRUST ME ON THIS. Give
it a week, maybe two, and you will never go back.

If you STILL can't get on board and want to jump ship, that's cool.
flowerhome is not for everyone and that's ok, I mean I'm not hurt by it,
whatever, I never liked you anyway. Here are some other alternatives
if you're looking for a blank starter theme. I'll just be here waiting
by the window, in case you ever decide to come back.

http://roots.io/starter-theme (way more complex but has a ton of cool features)
http://html5reset.org (super clean and great markup)
https://github.com/viewportindustries/starkers (not sure if it's still active, but still good)

That's it. It's time to jump in and get your hands dirty.
Seriously, why are you still reading this? Get to work!
If you have any issues or problems, you can create an issue on github
or find me on Twitter: @eddiemachado (SHAMELESS PLUG!).

Happy Developing!

(When you're done, you may want to remove all this nonsense before
passing it along to your client.)

WordPress Probz
So Theme Check (http://wordpress.org/plugins/theme-check/)
is constantly telling me that it needs these classes in the CSS even
though they are in the REAL stylesheet in library/css/style.css.
So we're gonna drop these here to keep it happy.
Great work, Theme Check (eye roll)
